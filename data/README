Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to release the complete visual field dataset. Consequently, we have included sensitivities only from the superior nasal vision area for each visual field (locations 17, 18, 24, 25, and 26 in Fig. 4 of our paper or locations 10, 11, 18, 19, and 20 in the dataset files), and masked all the other sensitivities as -1. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.
